# Coding Challenge

Hello, thank you for the opportunity to complete this challenge. While I have some experience in Go,
I chose to use Python (3.10.7) as it is the language I am most comfortable with, and know the best. The
dependencies inclue pandas (1.3.1) and pytest (7.1.3) which can be installed with pip.

However, for deployment I've included a Dockerfile. If Docker is installed, it can be built with
`docker build -t challenge .` and ran with `docker run challenge`

If docker is not an option, it can be ran from this directory with `python3 src/Main.py` .

Tests for each function can be found in test/function_test.py. To run the tests with pytest,
simply run `python3 -m pytest` in this directory. 

Once again, thank you for the opportunity complete this challenge. I look forward to hearing
back from you!

Best,

Myles
